This folder contains an example AGENTS.md snippet that you can add to the AGENTS.md file in your project root.

AGENTS.md is a convention for providing instructions to AI coding assistants. Multiple tools support this format, making it a good choice for projects where different team members may use different AI assistants.

Copy the contents of `AGENTS-example.md` into your project's `AGENTS.md` file to instruct AI agents to use agentsh for command execution.
